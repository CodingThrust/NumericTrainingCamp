## Make your software easy to use: Documentation

1. For light weighted package, you can include documentation in the `README.md` file.
2. In the Julia community, we use [`Documenter.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl) to generate documentation. It could be setup easily using [`PkgTemplates.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaCI/PkgTemplates.jl).
   1. Preview the documentation locally

## The final report
The final report should be in the form of a software documentation.

## Tips
